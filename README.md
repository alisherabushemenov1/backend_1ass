# Assignment #1 — Building Your First Express API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with JSON Storage
Task Management System - Express API with JSON Storage

Express.js REST API for managing tasks with CRUD operations and JSON file storage.

##  Project Description

This is a backend API for a task management system. The API allows managing objects (tasks): create, read, update, and delete records.

**Chosen Object:** `Objects` (tasks)

Each object contains:
- `id` - unique identifier (number)
- `name` - task name (required field)

##  Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-project-folder
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all necessary packages from `package.json`:
- Express.js - web framework for building the API

### Step 3: Create data.json file
Create a `data.json` file in the project root with the following content:
```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Buy milk"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Walk the dog"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Read a book"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Run the server
```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

You will see in the console:
```
Server started on http://localhost:3000
```

## 📮 Example Postman Requests

### Initial state of data.json

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Buy milk"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Walk the dog"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Read a book"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1. GET - Retrieve all objects

**Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:3000/objects
```

**Status:** `200 OK`

**Response:**
```json

  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Buy milk"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Walk the dog"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Read a book"
  }
]
```

---

### 2. POST - Create a new object

**Request:**
```
POST http://localhost:3000/objects
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Buy bread"
}
```

**Status:** `201 Created`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "name": "Buy bread"
}
```

---

### 3. PUT - Update an object

**Request:**
```
PUT http://localhost:3000/objects/1
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body:**

```
GET http://localhost:3000/objects
```

**Status:** `200 OK`
